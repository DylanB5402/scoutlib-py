For Epischool's Coding for Founders course, I decided to make a sample FRC scouting webapp that can hopefully be expanded on into an end-to-end scouting solution for FRC teams to use

Based off FRC 687's 2020 scouting forms: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTJWROl-exc2Vi0vgaBVz9z6laLctTKCqgzZtgxSTAwS3YDQ/viewform?usp=sf_link

Possible future plans:
- Ranked data analysis
- TheBlueAlliance integration
- Tools for Pick list generation (254's Robot tinder?)
